main.py is used to run one game simulation.
The mode sets logging level:
0 - no logging

1 - with breakpoint, that means you need to press enter to move to the next move

2 - print moves to console

4 - log moves into file with game id

tree_visualizer.py can draw trees based for a created MCTS simulation, you just have to uncomment it in mcts_simulation.py file
